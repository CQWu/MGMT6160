    "1. Feel free to use any Python IDE you are comfortable with.\n",
    "2. If you have Anaconda or some other Python distributions installed, you can lauch IPython notebook by typing 'ipython notebook\" in command line (Command Prompt or cmd on PC and Terminal in Mac).\n",
    "2. Keep in mind that WITHIN each problem (a through f), commands are executed SEQUENTIALLY. Therefore, commands executed earlier may affect the output of later commands.\n",
    "3. Each problem (a through f) has nothing to do with any other problem."

    "1. The Powerball lottery is played twice each week in many states. To play Powerball a participant must purchase a ticket and then select five numbers from the digits 1 through 55 and a Powerball number from the digits 1 through 42. To determine the winning numbers for each game, lottery officials draw five white balls out of a drum with 55 white balls, and one red ball out of a drum with 42 red balls. To win the jackpot, a participant’s numbers must match the numbers on the five white balls in any order and the number on the red Powerball. A variety of other cash prizes are awarded. For instance, a prize of 200K is paid if the participant’s five numbers match the numbers on the five white balls. \n",

    "1. A local bank reviewed its credit card policy with the intention of recalling some of its credit cards. In the past approximately 5% of cardholders defaulted, leaving the bank unable to collect the outstanding balance. Hence, management established a prior probability of .05 that any particular cardholder will default. The bank also found that the probability of missing a monthly payment is .20 for customers who do not default. Of course, the probability of missing a monthly payment for those who default is 1.\n",
